# Ironhack-Midterm-Project-  

### Title: Regression Analysis on Nutrition, Physical Activity, & Obesity  
# Members of the group:  
o	Aycha Kurtulush-Tanriverdi  
o	Poppy Nevin-Adley  
# Goal of the project:    
o	It is a Machine Learning Project (Linear Regression)  
o	Our goal will be prediction of obesity rate by various factors like socioeconomic status, physical activity, and weight status.    
o	We will also compare the obesity rate in each state to see if there is any meaningful difference.  
# Brief description of the dataset 
o	This dataset includes data on adult's diet, physical activity, and weight status from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  
o	This dataset is collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spittman1248/cdc-data-nutrition-physical-activity-obesity with 33 columns and more than 50.000 rows
